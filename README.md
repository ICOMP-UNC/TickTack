# Advanced Alarm Clock System  

This repository documents the final project for the **Digital Electronics 3** course, showcasing a sophisticated alarm clock system. The project include knowledge in computer engineering, digital electronics and  comibine these with good software development  practices. 
 This project was designed, structured, and implemented by me, a **Computer Engineering student at the National University of CÃ³rdoba**, currently in my fourth year of the program. 

## Overview  

The system is built around the **STM32F103C8 microcontroller**, featuring a Cortex-M3 architecture, using libopencm3 libraries and freeRTOS. 

Its design, requirements, and implementation reflect a deep integration of engineering principles and advanced programming techniques.  

## Key Features  

### Engineering and Development  

- **Version Control**:  
  The project was managed using the **GitFlow** standard to ensure an organized and collaborative development process.  

- **Documentation**:  
  Comprehensive technical documentation was created using the **Doxygen** standard, ensuring clarity and maintainability.  

- **Continuous Integration**:  
  A CI system evaluates code formatting and documentation quality with every pull request, maintaining high standards of code consistency and readability.  

### Additional Tools  

- **Pre-commit Hooks**:  
  Integrated to enforce coding standards and streamline the production pipeline.  

## Repository Organization  

The repository is structured into "phases" each represented by GitHub issues. These phases outline the roadmap, key milestones, and detailed engineering processes involved in the project's development. You can refer phase 0 to look about project plan, requeriments and diagrams.
